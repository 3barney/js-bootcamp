#Test Driven Development In JavaScript

##Introduction
TDD is an iterative development process where each iteration starts by writing a test which forms a part of the specification we are implementing.

If there are no unit tests as well, solutions produced with this approach may even contain code that is never executed, such as error handling logic and "flexible" argument handling, or it may contain edge cases that have not been thoroughly tested, if tested at all.

**Process:**

* Write a test
* Run tests, watch the new test fail
* Make the test pass
* Refactor to remove duplication
